#### Doctorant (PhD) - Graz university - 2019/2023

I am interested in the mathematical modeling of symbiotic relationships (mycorrhizae) and the resulting evolutionary processes by using game theoretic techniques. 
My aim is to model the role of fluctuating environmental conditions on the stability of symbioses.

#### Research assistant - CNRS - 2019

Understanding how and when human intervention to stabilize an ecosystemâ€™s dynamics may actually lead to a more fragile ecosystem. 
In particular, exploring whether minimizing commonly used stability measures, such as temporal variability, can lead to higher chance of extreme events, such as an ecosystem collapse.

#### Internship engineer - WeatherForce - 2018

Study of the classification in time regimes and their impacts for business uses.
Development of tools dedicated to the classification of a day.
Evaluation of their impact on user variables.
