          I am a PhD student in biology at the [University of Graz](https://www.uni-graz.at/en/). Generally, I seek to understand how systems (living beings, ecosystems, civilizations, brain, etc) are structured to deal with environmental changes. My ultimate goal is to develop a transdisciplinary theory of systems in changing environments with everyday life applications.

        content: >-
          Ecology is the science that studies the interactions between living beings. I am particularly interested in the organization of individuals in the face of environmental changes.

      - title: ... by using game theory
        content: >-
          Game theory is the mathematical study of strategic interactions between different agents. As far as I am concerned, agents are plants, animals or other living organisms. However, game theory can also be used to model interactions between humans, institutions, computers, etc.

        subtitle: Destabilizing effects of controlling the behavior of ecosystems
        content: >-
          Understanding how and when human intervention to stabilize an ecosystem’s dynamics may actually lead to a more fragile ecosystem. In particular, exploring whether minimizing commonly used stability measures, such as temporal variability, can lead to higher chance of extreme events, such as an ecosystem collapse.

          During my training, I mainly developed my skills in the areas of modeling, simulation and optimization. On the right, we can see a simulation carried out during fluid mechanics. You can see the pressure above an airplane wing.
