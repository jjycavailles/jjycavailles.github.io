          <div style="text-align: justify">I am a mathematician pursuing a Ph.D. in biology/ecology. I develop mathematical models to understand how ecosystems are structured to cope with environmental changes. <br/> My ultimate goal is to contribute to a transdisciplinary theory of systems in changing environments. My approach involves solving specific puzzles within relevant fields like ecology, ideally with practical applications for everyday life. Step by step, I aim to assimilate different concepts, such as disturbances or self-regulations, into a more general formal framework.</div>

          <div style="text-align: justify">Ecology, as a scientific discipline, explores the interactions among living beings within their environments. My particular interest lies in understanding how individuals organize themselves in response to environmental changes. This involves exploring the dynamic relationships between organisms and their surroundings, with a focus on adaptation strategies and the resilience of ecological systems in the face of changing environmental conditions.</div>

        content: >-
          <div style="text-align: justify">A mathematical model serves as an abstract representation of a tangible system, employing mathematical concepts and language. It aids in explaining the system, examining the impacts of various components, and making predictions about its behavior. <br/>I utilize various forms of models, including game theory and dynamical systems. Additionally, I have a keen interest in exploring other types of models such as information theory, network theory, decision theory, control theory, and category theory.</div>

          <div style="text-align: justify">I investigated the implications of human intervention in stabilizing ecosystem dynamics, exploring the possibility that certain interventions, particularly the reduction of common stability measures like temporal variability, may inadvertently increase the risk of extreme events, such as ecosystem collapse.</div>
