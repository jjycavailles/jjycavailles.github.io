In this article we will study a simple model that represents the spread of a forest fire. This model has been adapted from the example provided on the official site of [NetLogo](http://netlogoweb.org/launch#http://netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Earth%20Science/Fire.nlogo){:target="_blank" }.

We represent a piece of forest with green dots for the trees and black dots for the rocks.

Then, a fire is started on the left part of the forest. The lights are represented by red dots.
Fire can only burn trees (green dots). Thus the black dots prevent the fires from spreading.

Depending on the tree density (the proportion of green dots) the fires may or may not spread to the right of the forest.

To launch the simulation, click on "setup" then on "go".

What tree density will you choose, to maximize the production of wood without risking that a fire burns the whole forest? Try to restart the simulation (setup) with different densities (density) to maximize the final value of "money".

It can be seen that there is a critical density beyond which the forest will almost always burn to the right.
Indeed, for a density above 65% the forest to the right. On the other hand, for a density below 55%, the fires are quickly stopped due to the lack of trees side by side.
